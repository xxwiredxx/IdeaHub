# IdeaHub
A site where idea's can become reality with real life proffessional peer support (Proposed Fork of GitHub)

I want to make a site just like GitHub, and even a Fork, that can take the model of GitHub and expand it to any idea.

Example:

Lets say a user, user A, has the idea of creating a sticker that can indicate when meat goes bad by chemicals created by dangerous bacteria.

Since user A has a background in MicroBiology they know bacteria can omit chemicals when present, and is confident that they can be detected. 

Since user A cannot make the next step a reality, they post for help in the desired feild, Chemestry.

User B, a Chemist, wants to make contributions to the community, filters help requests, by the feild, and community contribution, to where they find user A's help request. Since user B feels User A's idea is possible and can contribute, they request user A to be a collaberator.

Actions can be assigned and managed the same way the GitHub's Actions work.
